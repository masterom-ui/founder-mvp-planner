# MVP Validator (Founder-First Tool)

This is a small, opinionated MVP that converts a raw startup idea into a
**strict 7-day build-or-kill plan**.

This tool is intentionally limited.
It is not an idea generator.
It is not a SaaS dashboard.
It exists to reduce early-stage build confusion for solo founders.

---

## What This Does

Input:
- Idea title
- 1–2 sentence description

Output:
- Founder TL;DR
- Scope lock (build / delay / do not build)
- User journey with decision logic
- 7-day execution path
- Clear success / kill criteria

Time to value: ~60 seconds.

---

## What This Does NOT Do

- No user accounts
- No saving history
- No analytics
- No payments
- No AI “chat”

All of the above are deliberately excluded.

---

## Why This Exists

Most founders don’t fail because they can’t build.
They fail because they build the wrong thing for too long.

This MVP tests whether structured thinking alone can improve founder clarity.

---

## Status

- Single-page MVP
- Static frontend + AI backend
- Actively validating with developers and founders
